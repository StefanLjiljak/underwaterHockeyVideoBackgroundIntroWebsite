        <h1>About UWH</h1>
        <p>
            Underwater hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush (mainly in the United Kingdom) is a globally played
            limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool
            into the opposing team's goal by propelling it with a hockey stick (pusher). It originated in England on
            1954 when Alan Blake, a founder of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club, invented the game he called
            Octopush as a means of keeping the club's members interested and active over the cold winter months when
            open-water diving lost its appeal. Underwater hockey is now played worldwide, with the Confédération
            Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques, abbreviated CMAS, as the world governing body. The first Underwater
            Hockey World Championship was held in Canada in 1980 after a false start in 1979 brought about by
            international politics and apartheid.
